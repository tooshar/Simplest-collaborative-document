# Simplest-collaborative-document
Your page should have one textarea that is un-editable by other users as soon as the first user clicks within it. All text changes a user makes should be visible in real-time to anyone who opens the document. The textarea should get unlocked if the page is closed or the user focuses out of it.

Just "npm install"!
